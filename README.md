# Gpredict_win32
Latest (V2.3.20) win32 build of Gpredict from gpredict.oz9aec.net

I've compiled this on MSYS2 MinGW 32 bit using the win32 Makefile from the orginal code. See 
https://github.com/csete/gpredict

I know Gpredict was especially written for Linux but I'd like to use it on Windows too (with SDRsharp, see 
https://github.com/alexwahl/SDRSharp.GpredictConnector) and Linux. I also know there is a win32 version of Gpredict at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gpredict/ but it seems that it isn't update anymore and had an annoying bug on 
windows flooding the log file. 

Just unzip the archive and run it.

Credits go to Csete for writing this nice and usefull app.
